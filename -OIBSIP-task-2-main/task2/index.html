          <h3><u>Cofounder of Apple Computer, Inc. (now Apple Inc.), and a charismatic pioneer of the personal computer era</u></h3>
          <p>
            <br>
            <b>Steve Jobs</b> was an American entrepreneur, computer designer and businessman. He cofounded the Apple company and oversaw the invention of the Apple, iMac and Macintosh computers as well as the iPod, iPhone and iPad. His vision of inexpensive computers designed for regular people helped launch the personal computing industry.
            Jobs was one of the first entrepreneurs to understand that the personal computer would appeal to a broad audience, at least if it did not appear to belong in a junior high school science fair. With Jobsâ€™s encouragement, Wozniak designed an improved model, the Apple II, complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit.
